This project implements a Machine Learning model to classify handwritten digits (0–9) using the MNIST dataset. A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is used to achieve high accuracy by automatically learning spatial features from image data.

The project is developed collaboratively by a group of two students using GitHub for version control and contribution tracking.
