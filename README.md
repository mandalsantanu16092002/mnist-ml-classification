# MNIST Machine Learning Classification

This repository demonstrates the implementation and comparison of multiple
machine learning algorithms on the MNIST handwritten digit dataset using
a collaborative GitHub workflow.

## Project Objectives
- Implement machine learning algorithms on MNIST
- Improve accuracy through algorithmic changes
- Practice GitHub collaboration using pull requests

## Algorithms Implemented
- Decision Tree Classifier (~90% accuracy)
- K-Nearest Neighbors (~97% accuracy)
- Support Vector Machine (~98% accuracy)

## Dataset
MNIST handwritten digit dataset (28×28 grayscale images).

## Repository Structure
- `src/` : Source code for ML models
- `notebooks/` : Experiments and visualization
- `data/` : Dataset information

## Results
The project demonstrates progressive accuracy improvement by applying
more advanced machine learning techniques.

## Baseline Model
The baseline implementation uses a Decision Tree classifier on the MNIST dataset
and achieves approximately 90% accuracy.

## How to Run
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python src/decision_tree.py
